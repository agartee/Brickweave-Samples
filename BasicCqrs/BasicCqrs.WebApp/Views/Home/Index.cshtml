    <p>Learn about building application with Brickweave <a href="https://github.com/agartee/Brickweave-Samples">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>
    In this demo application, the basic wire-up and usage of the <b>Brickweave.Cqrs</b> and <b>Brickweave.Cqrs.Cli</b> will 
    be demonstrated. Comments throughout the class files combined with the documentation on the GitHub project page should 
    give you a pretty good idea of what is going on.
</p>

<p>
    There is also a demo CLI client PowerShell script included at <b>./src/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1</b>. Running the client
    for the first time will prompt for the API endpoint (https://localhost:5001/cli/run) and then save that information for
    all future executions.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the commands and queries in this demo are auto-discoverable by the Brickweave.Cqrs.Cli service configuration calls
    in this web application's Startup.cs/ConfigureServices section. Make note that the "ListPeople" query is overridden from
    it's default CLI command name.
</p>

<p>
    Try some of these commands from the PowerShell command prompt:
</p>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 --help</code>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person --help</code>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person list</code>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person create --help</code>

<code><var>$person</var> = (./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person create --firstname "John" --lastname "Doe" | ConvertFrom-Json)</code>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person update --id <var>$person</var>.id --lastname "Wick"</code>

<code>./scripts/cli-client-nosecurity.ps1 person delete --id <var>$person</var>.id</code>
